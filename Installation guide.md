All commands are given in the ".../Course Project-master" folder.

Before running the app make sure to connect to "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/project" using for example MongoDBCompass.

execute commands "npm run install" and "npm run preinstall" then open another terminal in ".../Course Project-master".

To run the app use "npm run dev:client" and "SET NODE_ENV=production& npm run dev:server" each in their own terminals.

Now the react app should open itself in your brower, if it does not you can open it manually by opening in your browser "http://localhost:3000/"
