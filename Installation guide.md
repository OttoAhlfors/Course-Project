All commands are given in the ".../Course Project-master" folder.
execute commands "npm run install" and "npm run preinstall" then open another terminal in ".../Course Project-master" 
and run "npm run dev:client" and "SET NODE_ENV=production& npm run dev:server" each in their own terminals.
Now the react app should open itself in your brower, if it does not you can open it manually by opening in your browser "http://localhost:3000/"
